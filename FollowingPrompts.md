  github action for test fail with: go: no such tool "covdata"
- |
  lint github failed with: sh: 1: eslint: not found
- |
  test github failed with: sh: 1: vitest: not found
- |
  fix lint errors from `eslint .`
- |
  fix security errors from `gosec ./...`
- |
  The password generator shows `Error generating password` and the console says: `POST http://localhost:8080/privutil.PrivUtilService/GeneratePassword net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
- |
  Disable the option of in stalling via `go install` and update all the documentatino to either use the binaries from the release or build from source code
- |
  Go thro the wiki to verify.
- |
  Add a note in the wiki, readme, contribution and any other relevant file that the project is not to be installed via `go install` and should be run using the binaries from the release or built from source code, explaining why.
- |
  Expand the documentations, wherever it is relevant, on how to extract and use the binaries from the release or built from source code, do it for linux, windows and macos
- |
  Add in the wiki a page on how to configure privutil as a service in different platforms, linux, windows and macos
- |
  Remove `wangyoucao577/go-release-action` from publish.yml, instead use latest of `actions/upload-artifact` keeping the matrix for multiple platforms
- |
  Update the publish.yml file so the artifacts keep the original name (ensure for windows is .exe), compress in to privutil-{goos}-{goarch}.tar.gz for linux and mac, and privutil-{goos}-{goarch}.zip for windows. Ensure the files are upload to the release
- |
  Put the different grpc server capabilities in different files, group them per utility tool, do the same with tests
- |
  There is an opened bug where the Diff is not keeping the format of the original texts: https://github.com/odinnordico/PrivUtil/issues/7, it is also showing an end of line character. Fix the error
- |
  When theme is light, the text area are not changed and it is difficult to read
